# MapQuest ðŸ—º
An API and LLM based solution for tourism and travel, with recommendations, path tracking and markers!

<hr>

Our platform offers a comprehensive experience by integrating detailed service information with an interactive chatbot and real-time mapping directly on the homepage.

Utilizing the "ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo" API from OpenAI, our chatbot engages users by accepting inputs for starting and ending points, and suggests various places such as restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions, enhancing the travel experience for those without set plans.

Simplified Journey Planning: Users can easily input their travel details, including starting point, destination, and up to five stops, via a user-friendly form, making the planning process more intuitive.

Geocoding and Mapping using the Mappls API: Responses from the chatbot, presented in JSON format, undergo geocoding, after which the Mappls API is employed to accurately pinpoint all selected locations on the map, visually displaying the user's travel itinerary.

Efficient Route Mapping with Polylines: A precise route is plotted through the designated locations, utilizing polylines generated from the geocoded data, ensuring a seamless navigation experience from beginning to end.

Dynamic Detour Analysis: Our solution includes advanced detour visualization, dynamically assessing distances between the starting point and destination, as well as any added stops by the user. This functionality guarantees an optimized travel route, customized to the userâ€™s individual journey preferences.
